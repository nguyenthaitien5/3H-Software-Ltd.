INTRODUCTION: 
>IDEA:    Modern E-commerce eMarket Application (Electronic Marketplace Platform)
  The E-commerce marketplace or the online e-commerce market is a place or a website where one can find different brands of products coming from multiple vendors,
  shops or persons showcased on the same platform.
>REASON:  Fundamentally, ecommerce platforms are the backbone of any online retail enterprise, allowing the front-end and back-end to work in tandem and efficiently.
Ecommerce platforms are the girders of the ecommerce building, providing a rigid structure on which a B2B or B2C ecommerce enterprise is supported
